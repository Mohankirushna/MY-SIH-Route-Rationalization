# 🚗 SIH Route Rationalization

An intelligent route optimization system developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). This project focuses on optimizing delivery or service routes to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance service quality.

## 🌟 Features

- **Route Optimization**: Advanced algorithms to find the most efficient routes
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live tracking of vehicles and deliveries
- **Demand Prediction**: AI-powered prediction of service demand across regions
- **Multi-stop Planning**: Optimize routes with multiple delivery or service points
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost breakdown for different route options
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for route visualization and management

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI/Flask
- **Frontend**: React.js/Streamlit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **Maps & Routing**: OSRM/Google Maps API
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for frontend, if applicable)
- Docker (for containerization)
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohankirushna/MY-SIH-Route-Rationalization.git
   cd MY-SIH-Route-Rationalization
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend (if applicable):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update the .env file with your configuration
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend (if applicable):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port)
